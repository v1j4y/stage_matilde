  abstract      = {The roots of swarm intelligence are deeply embedded in the biological study of self-organized behaviors in social insects. From the routing of traffic in telecommunication networks to the design of control algorithms for groups of autonomous robots, the collective behaviors of these animals have inspired many of the foundational works in this emerging research field. For the first issue of this journal dedicated to swarm intelligence, we review the main biological principles that underlie the organization of insects’ colonies. We begin with some reminders about the decentralized nature of such systems and we describe the un- derlying mechanisms of complex collective behaviors of social insects, from the concept of stigmergy to the theory of self-organization in biological systems.We emphasize in partic- ular the role of interactions and the importance of bifurcations that appear in the collective output of the colony when some of the system’s parameters change. We then propose to categorize the collective behaviors displayed by insect colonies according to four functions that emerge at the level of the colony and that organize its global behavior. Finally, we ad- dress the role of modulations of individual behaviors by disturbances (either environmental or internal to the colony) in the overall flexibility of insect colonies. We conclude that fu- ture studies about self-organized biological behaviors should investigate such modulations to better understand how insect colonies adapt to uncertain worlds.},

	abstract = {The double exchange is a well-known and technically important phenomenon in solid state physics. Ionizing a system composed of two antiferromagnetically coupled high-spin units, the ground state of which is a singlet state, may actually produce a high-spin ground state. This work illustrates the possible occurrence of such a phenomenon in organic chemistry. The here-considered high-spin units are triangulenes, the ground state of which is a triplet. Bridging two of them through a benzene ring produces a molecular architecture of singlet ground state. A careful exploitation of a series of unrestricted density functional calculations enables one to avoid spin contamination in the treatment of the doublet states and shows that under ionization the system becomes of quartet multiplicity in its ground state. The possibility to align more than three spins from conjugated hydrocarbon polyradicals is explored, considering partially hydrogenated triangulenes. A dramatic example shows that ionization of a singlet ground state molecule may generate a decuplet.},

	abstract = {The objective of this paper is to design a consistent series of organic molecules that may present a double exchange mechanism and study their low energy spectrum using spin unrestricted Density Functional Theory. For this purpose, organic tetra-methylene methane units having an S = 1 spin ground state and diamagnetic organic bridges are taken as building blocks for constructing molecules having two or more magnetic units. When biunit systems are ionized, the ground state of the resulting molecular ions may be either a quartet, if the spectrum is ruled by a double exchange mechanism, or a doublet, if it obeys the logic of a monoelectronic picture. A strategy based on the physical analysis of the leading interactions is followed in order to energetically favor a high-spin ground state. It is shown that the most promising compounds involve bridges that have both a large gap between the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals and small coefficients on the atoms to which the magnetic units are connected. While the followed strategy enables one to conceive organic compounds exhibiting a double exchange phenomenon, it is shown that the electronic mechanism ruling the spectrum of such organic double exchange compounds is different from that of their inorganic homologues. A new method to reconstruct the spectrum of low energy from various spin unrestricted DFT solutions is proposed and applied. Finally monodimensional and bidimensional periodic lattices based on the most promising organic architecture are suggested.},

This complex can be seen as the simplest system exhibiting the so-called double-exchange phenomenon. This effect is usually rationalized in the minimal valence space defined by the partially occupied orbitals. The analysis reveals that the leading antiferromagnetic contributions implies the atomic excited (non-Hund) states through a mechanism proposed by Anderson et al. and Blondin et al. but the energy spacings deviate significantly from those predicted by the usually accepted model Hamiltonian. An analytic derivation explains these deviations and an alternative modelization of the spectrum is proposed. The extensive CI calculations also reveal the existence of another mechanism involving low-lying virtual orbitals with a large component on the 4s of the Ni atoms and that strongly stabilizes the upper excited states.},

	abstract = {It is assumed (1) that the interaction between the incomplete d shells of the transition elements is insufficient to disrupt the coupling between the d electrons in the same shells, and (2) that the exchange interaction between adjacent d shells always has the same sign irrespective of distance of separation. The direct interaction between adjacent d shells then invariably leads to a tendency for an antiferromagnetic alignment of d spins. The body-centered cubic structure of the transition metals V, Cr, Cb, Mo, Ta, and W is thereby interpreted, as well as more complex lattices of certain alloys. It is demonstrated that the spin coupling between the incomplete d shells and the conduction electrons leads to a tendency for a ferromagnetic alignment of d spins. The occurrence of ferromagnetism is thereby interpreted in a much more straightforward manner than through the ad hoc assumption of a reversal in sign of the exchange integral. The occurrence of antiferromagnetism and of ferromagnetism in various systems is readily understood, and certain simple rules are deduced for deciding which type of magnetism will occur in particular alloys.},

A FeIII (high spin) FeII (high spin) binuclear complex would constitute an example. In such systems electron transfer and electron exchange are expected. If the compound belongs to class II (Robin and Day classification) we find that the activation energy of the thermal electron transfer and the intensity of the intervalence band are spin dependent but that the energies of spin states are given by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian with a new expression for the exchange parameter. For class III binuclear complexes a quite different behavior is found. The energy of the intervalence band is spin dependent but energies of spin states are no longer given by the Heisenberg Hamiltonian.},

While in S = 1 ∕ 2 spin systems the Heisenberg Hamiltonian involving only bilinear exchange interactions is reliable for the description of the magnetic states, biquadratic exchange interactions must be sometimes introduced for S = 1 (or higher) spin systems to account for isotropic deviations to Heisenberg behavior. The analysis establishes that the excited atomic states, the so-called non-Hund states, are responsible for the main contribution to the deviations. The kinetic exchange contribution and the spin, hole, and particle polarizations increase the magnetic coupling but essentially maintain the Heisenberg pattern. The importance of the different contributions has been studied for a series of Ni 2 compounds with a polarizable double azido bridge. The coupling between two Fe 3 + ions in the molecular crystal Na 3 Fe S 3 , which is known experimentally to present large deviations to Heisenberg behavior, has also been investigated.},

It is shown here that this operator cannot describe the effect of the excited atomic non-Hund states which brought the most important contribution to the deviations.

	abstract = {The variational energies of broken-symmetry single determinants are frequently used (especially in the Kohn–Sham density functional theory) to determine the magnetic coupling between open-shell metal ions in molecular complexes or periodic lattices. Most applications extract the information from the solutions of m s max and m s min eigenvalues of S ̂ z magnetic spin momentum, assuming that a mapping of these energies on the energies of an Ising Hamiltonian is grounded. This approach is unable to predict the possible importance of deviations from the simplest form of the Heisenberg Hamiltonians. For systems involving s = 1 magnetic centers, it cannot provide an estimate of neither the biquadratic exchange integral nor the three-body operator interaction that has recently been proven to be of the same order of magnitude [Phys. Rev. B70, 132412 (2007)]. The present work shows that one may use other broken-symmetry solutions of intermediate values of m s to evaluate the amplitude of these additional terms. The here-derived equations rely on the assumption that an extended Hubbard-type Hamiltonian rules the interactions between the magnetic electrons. Numerical illustrations on a model problem of two O 2 molecules and a fragment of the La 2 NiO 4 lattice are reported. The results obtained using a variable percentage of Fock exchange in the BLYP functional are compared to those provided by elaborate wave function calculations. The relevant percentage of Fock exchange is system dependent but a mean value of 30\% leads to acceptable amplitudes of the effective exchange interaction.},
