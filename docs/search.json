    "text": "Results and discussion\n\nOutline\nThe document layout should follow the style of the journal concerned. Where appropriate, sections and subsections should be added in the normal way. If the class options are set correctly, warnings will be given if these should not be present.\n\n\nReferences\nThe class makes various changes to the way that references are handled. The class loads natbib, and also the appropriate bibliography style. References can be made using the normal method; the citation should be placed before any punctuation, as the class will move it if using a superscript citation style3. The use of natbib allows the use of the various citation commands of that package have shown something. Long lists of authors will be automatically truncated in most article formats, but not in supplementary information or reviews. If you encounter problems with the citation macros, please check that your copy of natbib is up to date. The demonstration database file bibliography.bib shows how to complete entries correctly.\nMultiple citations to be combined into a list can be given as a single citation. This uses the mciteplus package. Citations other than the first of the list should be indicated with a star.\nThe class also handles notes to be added to the bibliography. These should be given in place in the document. As with citations, the text should be placed before punctuation. A note is also generated if a citation has an optional note. This assumes that the whole work has already been cited: odd numbering will result if this is not the case .\n\n\nFloats\nNew float types are automatically set up by the class file. The means graphics are included as follows (Figure 4). As illustrated, the float is here if possible.\n\nYour scheme graphic would go here: .eps format for \\(\\LaTeX\\), or .pdf (or .png) for pdf\\\\(\\LaTeX\\) {{&lt; smallcaps chemdraw &gt;}} files are best saved as .eps files: these can be scaled without loss of quality, and can be converted to .pdf files easily using eps2pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: An example scheme\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs well as the standard float types table and figure, the class also recognises scheme, chart and graph.\n\n\nFigure 5: A second example figure\n\n\n\nCharts, figures and schemes do not necessarily have to be labelled or captioned. However, tables should always have a title. It is possible to include a number and label for a graphic without any title, using an empty argument to the \\caption macro.\nThe use of the different floating environments is not required, but it is intended to make document preparation easier for authors. In general, you should place your graphics where they make logical sense; the production process will move them if needed.\n\n\nMath(s)\nThe achemso class does not load any particular additional support for mathematics. If packages such as amsmath are required, they should be loaded in the preamble. However, the basic LaTeX math(s) input should work correctly without this. Some inline material \\(y = mx + c\\) or \\(1 + 1 = 2\\) followed by some display.\n\\[ A = \\pi r^2 \\]\nIt is possible to label equations in the usual way (Equation 3).\n\\[\n  \\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d}x} \\, r^2 = 2r\n\\tag{3}\\]\nThis can also be used to have equations containing graphical content. To align the equation number with the middle of the graphic, rather than the bottom, a minipage may be used."

    "text": "Extra information when writing JACS Communications\nWhen producing communications for J.~Am. Chem. Soc., the class will automatically lay the text out in the style of the journal. This gives a guide to the length of text that can be accommodated in such a publication. There are some points to bear in mind when preparing a JACS Communication in this way. The layout produced here is a model for the published result, and the outcome should be taken as a guide to the final length. The spacing and sizing of graphical content is an area where there is some flexibility in the process. You should not worry about the space before and after graphics, which is set to give a guide to the published size. This is very dependant on the final published layout.\nYou should be able to use the same source to produce a JACS Communication and a normal article. For example, this demonstration file will work with both type=article and type=communication. Sections and any abstract are automatically ignored, although you will get warnings to this effect.\n\nPlease use “The authors thank …” rather than “The authors would like to thank …”.\nThe author thanks Mats Dahlgren for version one of achemso, and Donald Arseneau for the code taken from cite to move citations after punctuation. Many users have provided feedback on the class, which is reflected in all of the different demonstrations shown in this document.\n\n\nThis will usually read something like: “Experimental procedures and characterization data for all new compounds. The class will automatically add a sentence pointing to the information on-line:"
